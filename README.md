# Disclaimer

I don't think I need to give a disclaimer about this; if you're using a selfbot for any reason, you're going against Discord's ToS some way or another which may result in the termination of your account.

# Installation


Make sure you install and add [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to path (*was made with 3.8.5 but latest should be fine*)

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/fvckgrimm/Selfbot.git
```

Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements.txt

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

edit config.json with your token and prefered prefix and run:

```
python main.py
```

you can obtain your token following this [guide](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs).

# Info


Mainly made to improve a shitty bot i scrapped together previously. I don't really plan to keep working on this so if something breaks ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. And if it just outright doesn't work, i don't know what to tell you.
